### Hi everyone !

I am a french computer science student, working on different projects.

I use Python, C++, and Lua as main programming languages.

I have a knack for **tooling** and **automation**.  
I love to build tools that will help people be more productive, or automate already existing manual workflows !

## My projects
A lot of my recent projects are stored on a University GitLab and a student organization Git server.  
If you want to take a look at these, don't hesitate to shoot me a DM and I'll give you read access.

### TinyTest
A stupidly simple C++ testing framework, being made as a single header of only macros.

It was made with the intention of allowing computer science students to write tests for their code as quickly as possible, while having very low overhead on the development process.  
It is extremely simple to understand, and well documented with Doxygen !

### AlgorithmicEditor
My most recent and best project, a **full code editor** with community plugins and themes support, made for students to easily and quickly sketch pseudo-code to map out a program, before automatically translating it to either Algorithmic Syntax or C++.

It is very modular, with support for a lot of hot reloading, and config options.  
A few mistakes :  
- Classes are too big.
  - The `App` class takes over a thousand lines of code by itself !
- The project class structure could have benefitted more forethought and planning. But it remains a weekend prototype that blew waaay out of proprtion, soooo...

### ACOS
My software-based Operating System : The ACOS.

This was my second project using Python.  
The aim to remake an even older project : The ACOS, a Web-based operating system in PHP.  
If that sounds cursed, it's because it very much was !

I lost the sources for that project, but it had become an unmaintainable mess of copy-pasted source files and code, with barely any function holding anything together.

Mind you, I was 13-14 when I made the Web version of the ACOS, so mistakes like these are understandable, and were a part of my learning process.  
So, at 16 years of age, I was ready to tackle a new version of the ACOS, this time made in Python with [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html).

This repo is *also* an unmaintainable mess.  
This was entirely done in a procedural manner, with no classes to speak of.  
It truly is composed of only two main source files : `boot.py` and `main.py`.

Oh well, you'll see for yourself.  
But it allowed me to learn and improve, and those mistakes I wouldn't do again.

### ACPL
My first *real* project is a programming language, the ACPL.

This remains one of the projects I learned the most on.  
There was no research.  
No prior skill or experience.  
Just a 15 year old who sat in front of my keyboard and typed for hours upon hours, managing to find... Unorthodox solutions to uncommon problems.  

You'll see in this repo every single beginner mistake I made :
- No plan
- Redundancy
- A 1000+ line while loop
- An 8-level nested statement
- And many many more...
