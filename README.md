### Hi everyone !

I am a french computer science student, working on different projects.

I use Python, C++, and Lua as main programming languages.

I have a knack for **tooling** and **automation**.  
I love to build tools that will help people be more productive, or automate already existing manual workflows !

## My projects
A lot of my recent projects are stored on a University GitLab and a student organization Git server.  
If you want to take a look at these, don't hesitate to shoot me a DM and I'll give you read access.

### AlgorithmicEditor
My most recent and best project, a **full code editor** with community plugins and themes support, made for students to easily and quickly sketch pseudo-code to map out a program, before automatically translating it to either Algorithmic Syntax or C++.

### ACPL
My first project is a programming language, the ACPL.

This remains one of the projects I learned the most on.  
There was no research.  
No prior skill or experience.  
I just sat in front of my keyboard and typed for hours upon hours, managing to find... Unorthodox solutions to uncommon problems.  

You'll see in this repo every single beginner mistake I made :
- No plan
- Redundancy
- A 1000+ line while loop
- An 8-level nested statement
- And many many more...

My software-based Operating System : The ACOS.
